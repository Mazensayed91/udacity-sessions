com.twitter.android," so much room for improvement... the twitter app has been around for several years and yet it still hasn't lived up to its full potential. here's an example: how don't we have the capability to save gifs and videos? not only that, but it'd be cool if we can customize and have different layouts and appearances. simple updates like those would make this app so much better, not lame ones like changing favorites to likes. hopefully these ideas can be considered for 2016.",0
com.twitter.android," ads placement is anoying we know ads was one of your source of income, but placing ads in replies is taking anoying and greed to another level. facebook had more ads, but have you ever see them in the comments section?",0

com.twitter.android, still not background refreshing despite the daily updates this had been working well until a recent version. it no longer refreshes in the background and therefore is very slow to load when i open the app. stop updating things that used to work.,0
com.twitter.android," could be so much better if they'd stop making unneeded changes. while i love twitter, i hate that there is no paid service to remove ads. also there should be a quicker way to access your lists (like a shortcut on the home screen to a specific list would be awesome) and also i've heard that twitter is testing a non-chronological timeline. that is the worst idea ever. if that is implemented without a way to turn it off, i won't use twitter anymore. honestly, if third party apps had push notifications, i wouldn't use the official app at all. oh, and moments is dumb.",0

com.linkedin.android," don't like the new look looks like a cheap dating site now. professional vibe is gone, poor facebook knockoff is here to stay. it's not just the aesthetics but the design as well. simple things, like viewing my connections or viewers, require more time, more taps, and more effort than before. others' connections are listed seemingly randomly, making it arduous to find anyone. it's worse on iphone, where speed is at a snail's pace. linkedin has lost its identity, and if it continues in this direction, it will lose its userbase too.",0
com.linkedin.android," no respect for privacy linkedin takes advantage of how android manages permissions as well as using an persistent opt out mechanism to aggresively scan your phone's contacts in order to constantly nag about inviting them whilst the app harvests your data. the practices are unethical and makes one question how the company treats private data. linkedin is an important tool to use today but with the way the company behaves, it is better to uninstall the app and rely on the web version when its needed.",0
com.linkedin.android, so unstable after daily updates had it 4 stars for a long time. this week there were daily updates and the latest one didn't fix my problem. i get a pure white screen upon launch. that would be fine if this was a  flashlight app. i uninstalled and reinstalled. still a flashlight.,0

com.king.candycrushsaga,  i get all these requests on fb but yet i go on candy crush and nothing getting very tired of it. then using the special candys they dont even do anything anymore what use to clear all rows no clears 3. no wonder no one plays this anymore,0
com.king.candycrushsaga, either make the moving forward process 3 bars or less time to wait you need to change the peramiters to move to the next episode....tired of waiting 3 days as you paid people up with other people who no longer play.,0
com.king.candycrushsaga, candy crush i rated it a 2 star because when i send out ticket request i never get them. i know for a fact that 6 people sent me tickets back and i only got 1,0
com.king.candycrushsaga, memory game the levels are so hard and less moves . l do no how to pass 95 levels but levels are so bour. chico bar is very hard to finish. please any of you send me life,1
com.king.candycrushsaga, it takes me two levels back and no boosters not happy with this game.i passed the hard level an i was two level forward to the hard level and i had boosters.after work i open the game no booster and i was two steps back .back to the hard level.after that the game switches its self off,0
com.king.candycrushsaga,  what is the point of having the jackpot when we spin the wheel if i never get it i mean has anyone ever got the jackpot if not i think it's completely pointless and should be taken off,0
com.king.candycrushsaga," umm.... while this game has gotten kinda old, and i've basically replaced it with the soda saga game, i still like playing this but for some reason, for i don't know how many days now, every time i go to open this game it'll load a little and then crash closed. fix please!!!!!!!!",1
com.king.candycrushsaga,  i have to call it one of the most addictive games ever.... but now i'm dropping my rating because it took all my bonus candy away with the last update.. fix that guys... not ok!,0

com.king.candycrushsaga," simple fun game this is the type of game that can be easy and difficult at the same time. each game is determined by how the candies drop, so sometimes you can fly through a level and other times you can be stuck for days. a good time filler when you have 5 mins to spare.",1
com.king.candycrushsaga,  the scoring system on facebook gains more points than mobile on jelly levels and i think that needs to be changed. e.g.  using a colour bomb with jellies on candies gives much more points on fb  than mobile. also there are no fish once  u finish jelly levels. please change the scoring system so it is the same for both platforms and that there is no bias against mobile.,0
com.king.candycrushsaga, i love playing candy crush but... why when u go to another episode  you have to wait for along time for example i was in level 50 and i passed it and had to wait 75 hours for episode 3 the game is good and very addictive but i don't like the waiting for the episodes đł by the way good đwork,0

com.Slack,  works fine for the most part. not sure why it decides to sometimes notify me and sometimes not. i guess it has something to do with inactivity on other logged in devices (i'm usually logged in 24/7 on 2 computers and a phone).,1

com.evernote," neat idea, but let-down by no linux support. an application like evernote is only as useful as the service behind it, and the service behind a concept like evernote is only as useful as the availability of an application or program to connect to said service... which is where evernote fails - it is not natively available for linux-based operating systems (such as ubuntu). sure, the android application works well enough - but when the only way to access evernote under a linux-based operating system is via a web browser, it quickly looses its appeal.",0

com.rovio.angrybirds, always entertaining we all know angry birds by now. definitely an enjoyable and entertaining game to help you kill time. the only thing that i don't like about it are the advertisements when i'm playing with my wifi of data turned on. they can be a bit disruptive during game play,1
com.rovio.angrybirds," freaking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*!! it has no real story line but it doesn't matter.this was the first video game i ever played so i obviously love it.it's almost better than super mario brother for crying out loud,the characters are great,the pig's are cute,and it has my favorite bird in it hall (or green bird)not gonna get in to the details of why i love hall but mea. also the pigs forts are awesome .so that's why i rated angry birds five out of five game of the year",1
com.rovio.angrybirds," great game, too much ads angry birds is fun and a great way to kill time, unfortunately it falls short of perfect due to numerous ads littering the game. unless you get ad-free, be prepared to get ads up the butt.",1
com.rovio.angrybirds, pretty good the people who don't like the power ups can just turn them off in the first part of the game!!!!! i also like the red's mighty feathers.,1
com.rovio.angrybirds, smart and fun i'm late to the party. if i knew it was this fun i'd have downloaded it sooner.,1
com.rovio.angrybirds, lovely a lovely game for all i love this game so much and my mom too . my mom also enjoy this game so much . thank you rovio team to make this kind of game .,1
com.rovio.angrybirds," kinda like a 2d kingdom havoc fun!  if kingdom havoc was 2d and used a sling shot, it'd be close.  angry birds is crazy good though.  a handful of colorful birds with different and interesting superpowers keep things fresh from level to level.  this game gets more difficult along the way, but it's cool to get better as you practice.",1
com.rovio.angrybirds, classic game ruined by ads. uninstalled this o one classic game utterly unplayable due to excessive ads. installed the other day for my 5 year old to keep him quiet. wondered why he kept crying and complaining. realised he was constantly being bombarded with adds that took him out of the game after almost every level. ridiculous.,1
com.rovio.angrybirds," the best game about they dont call this the no.1 app for nothing, its the original and best clean game about. one needs to work out how best to strike the piggy structures by flinging the birds in a sling (funny though, i thought they had wings). it is a wonderful novel idea for a game and will no doubt will continue to appeal to a wide audience for some time to come! (it's as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s) it's so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it. for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future. the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internet, but thankfully, the in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline.",1
com.rovio.angrybirds, such an awesome game love it a really fun games definitely suggest any reader of this description to get it is so good you will enjoy the game and it doesn't feel like a waste of time afterwards it is very easy to play and it's very fun to find ways to knock down the building just by using one bird thoroughly recommend it it is very fun and you're so good so please download this game will be blessed,1
com.rovio.angrybirds, cool really great and awesome graphics. offline is great for going to a no-wifi place love it,1
com.rovio.angrybirds,  i remember back when this was a âł3 ipod app not filled with bullshit like adds and powerups. go back to what you used to be! +rio ruined every other angry birds game.,1
com.rovio.angrybirds," 2many adds. great game ruined by too many adds! way too many adds now. not even fun anymore. was great, now it's terrible.",0
com.rovio.angrybirds," game glitches nice, you have all the cheesy, simple reviews right up first. hey, robin!! i was nearly completed the game and i had to uninstall/reinstall, losing all my achievements. and it's still freezing up. it even switches to one if those annoying :30 ads in the middle of a game. is there a reason why my game was working just fine until the update?",0
com.rovio.angrybirds," good time waster. good fun, but getting old and spams ads really bad.",1
com.rovio.angrybirds," not the same with my hand on my heart. i can honestly say that the first angry birds was great. the latter is a horrible mess of horrible games cashing in on the original success. unfortunately, this hame has suffered the same fate... it is no longer the brilliant game it once was... it's  an updated version, with none of the original stuff that once made it great...",1
com.rovio.angrybirds," love it!!!!!!! i love angry birds, i can sit and play on for hours upon end. love the challenges they threw at me",1
com.rovio.angrybirds," game ruined because of ads. i felt like re-downloading after haven't playing it in awhile, but i was immediately frustrated. a 20 second, awful mobile game ad popped up after the second level, and after looking at the store, i realized that you have to pay to remove ads. yep, uninstalling.",0
com.rovio.angrybirds, ads way to many ads can't even enjoy the game with the amount of ads i have to watch. every other level there's an ad. that's just ridiculous.,0
com.rovio.angrybirds,"  great game, but too many ads almost not worth playing.",1
com.rovio.angrybirds," fun but hard angry birds is really fun video game that people from at least 6 year olds and people that are a lot, a lot, a lot of years older than that. just one thing: it's really, really hard. but a challenge can teach children how to control their tempers. even though it can ba a little frustrating.",1
com.rovio.angrybirds, too many ads far more adverts than any other game i've played. i know it's free and they need the ads to make a profit but there needs to be a balance.,1
com.rovio.angrybirds, loved it i loooooooooooooovvved it because it is incredible  awesome  and it's in go power and make a new clash of clans the same thing  butt better,1
com.rovio.angrybirds, all time legendary game the birthday party levels and short fuse levels are fantastic.especially when the pigs crash onto different chemicals is just great.suggestion to all those players who cringe about too much ads is close ur wi-fi connection and then play the game.then the ads won't trouble you.,1
com.rovio.angrybirds," ads are way to heavy listen to the bad reviews. there are ads after every round, whether you pass it or fail it. sometimes there are ads before the next round starts to. you spend more time on ads than game play. i develop web apps, and honestly many people rely on ads to make a living. i can appreciate that all to well. however, these developers have went far beyond that. frankly, they are disrespectful nitwits.",0
com.rovio.angrybirds," fun works perfectly well. ads aren't as annoying as you think, especially for a free game.",1
com.rovio.angrybirds, they're everywhere i see angry birds everywhere because i can't stop playing this game. get out my head devs! 4 đ because nothing's perfect,1
